# OTP Identity Challenge

**Identity verification for approval workflows in OpenClaw.**

This skill enables agents to challenge users for fresh two-factor authentication proof before executing sensitive actions—deployments, financial operations, data access, or any command with change-control concerns.

## Purpose

This is **not** chat channel security—it's **identity verification for specific actions**.

When your agent needs to execute something sensitive, it challenges the user to prove their identity with a time-based one-time password (TOTP) or YubiKey, providing cryptographic proof they authorized the action.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install via ClawHub
clawhub install otp

# Or clone manually
cd ~/.openclaw/skills
git clone https://github.com/ryancnelson/otp-skill.git otp
```

## Use Cases

- **Deploy commands**: Require fresh 2FA before `kubectl apply` or `terraform apply`
- **Financial operations**: Verify identity before wire transfers or payment approvals
- **Data access**: Challenge before exporting customer data or PII
- **Admin operations**: Verify before user account modifications or permission changes
- **Change control**: Enforce approval workflows with cryptographic proof of identity

## How It Works

1. Your agent or skill calls `verify.sh` with the user's ID and their code
2. The skill validates the code (TOTP or YubiKey)
3. If valid, verification state is recorded with a timestamp
4. Other scripts can check `check-status.sh` to see if verification is still fresh
5. Verification expires after a configured interval (default: 24 hours)

## Installation

### Via ClawHub (recommended)
```bash
clawhub install otp
```

### Manual
```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/skills
git clone https://github.com/ryancnelson/otp-skill.git otp
```

### Check Dependencies
After installation, verify required dependencies:
```bash
# Check what's available
which jq && echo "✅ jq available" || echo "❌ Install: brew install jq"
which python3 && echo "✅ python3 available" || echo "❌ Install: brew install python3"
which oathtool && echo "✅ oathtool available" || echo "❌ Install: brew install oath-toolkit"
```

**Note:** `oathtool` is optional - the skill includes a built-in TOTP generator, but `oathtool` provides additional validation.

---

## TOTP Setup

### 1. Generate a TOTP Secret

Use the included secret generator:
```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/skills/otp
./generate-secret.sh "your-email@example.com"
```

This will display:
- A QR code to scan with your authenticator app
- The base32 secret for manual entry
- Configuration instructions

**Alternative:** Use any other TOTP secret generator. You need a **base32-encoded secret**.

### 2. Scan QR Code

Add the secret to your authenticator app:
- Google Authenticator
- Authy
- 1Password
- Bitwarden
- Any RFC 6238 compatible app

### 3. Store the Secret

**Option A: In your OpenClaw config**
```yaml
# ~/.openclaw/config.yaml
security:
  otp:
    secret: "YOUR_BASE32_SECRET_HERE"
    accountName: "user@example.com"
    issuer: "OpenClaw"
    intervalHours: 24  # Re-verify every 24 hours
```

**Option B: In environment variable**
```bash
export OTP_SECRET="YOUR_BASE32_SECRET_HERE"
```

**Option C: In 1Password** (recommended for security)
```yaml
security:
  otp:
    secret: "op://vault/OpenClaw OTP/totp"
```

### 4. Test Your Setup

```bash
# Get current code from your authenticator app (6 digits)
./verify.sh "testuser" "123456"  # Replace with actual code
# Should show: ✅ OTP verified for testuser (valid for 24 hours)

# Check verification status
./check-status.sh "testuser"
# Should show: ✅ Valid for 23 more hours
```

---

## YubiKey Setup (Alternative to TOTP)

If you have a YubiKey, you can use touch-to-verify instead of typing 6-digit codes.

### 1. Get Yubico API Credentials

1. Go to **https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey/**
2. Enter your email address
3. Touch your YubiKey to generate an OTP in the form field
4. Submit — you'll receive a **Client ID** and **Secret Key**

**Troubleshooting "Invalid OTP" during registration:**

If Yubico's site rejects your OTP, your key may not be registered with Yubico's cloud:

1. Install **YubiKey Manager** from https://www.yubico.com/support/download/yubikey-manager/
2. Open it, go to **Applications → OTP → Configure Slot 1**
3. Select **Yubico OTP** and check **"Upload to Yubico"**
4. This re-registers your key with Yubico's servers
5. Try getting API credentials again

### 2. Configure Credentials

**Option A: In your OpenClaw config**
```yaml
# ~/.openclaw/config.yaml
security:
  yubikey:
    clientId: "12345"
    secretKey: "your-base64-secret-key"
```

**Option B: In environment variables**
```bash
export YUBIKEY_CLIENT_ID="12345"
export YUBIKEY_SECRET_KEY="your-base64-secret-key"
```

### 3. Test YubiKey Verification

```bash
# Touch your YubiKey when prompted
./verify.sh "testuser" "cccccccccccc..."  # paste YubiKey output
# Should show: ✅ YubiKey verified for testuser (valid for 24 hours)
```

### Using Both TOTP and YubiKey

You can configure both methods. The script auto-detects which to use based on the code format:
- **6 digits** → TOTP validation
- **44 characters** → YubiKey validation

This lets you use TOTP on your phone and YubiKey at your desk.

## Usage Examples

### For Skill Authors

When your skill needs to verify user identity:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# In your sensitive-action.sh

# Source the OTP skill
source ../otp/verify.sh

USER_ID="$1"
OTP_CODE="$2"

# Challenge the user
if ! verify_otp "$USER_ID" "$OTP_CODE"; then
  echo "❌ OTP verification failed. Run: /otp <code>"
  exit 1
fi

# Proceed with sensitive action
echo "✅ Identity verified. Proceeding with deployment..."
kubectl apply -f production.yaml
```

### Checking Verification Status

```bash
#!/bin/bash
source ../otp/check-status.sh

if check_otp_status "$USER_ID"; then
  echo "✅ User verified within last 24 hours"
else
  echo "⚠️ Verification expired. User must verify again."
fi
```

### For End Users

When prompted by a skill:
```
User: deploy to production
Agent: 🔒 This action requires identity verification. Please provide your OTP code.

User: /otp 123456
Agent: ✅ Identity verified. Deploying to production...
```

### Deploy Command with OTP

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# skills/deploy/production.sh

source ../otp/verify.sh

USER="$1"
CODE="$2"
SERVICE="$3"

# Require OTP for production deploys
if ! verify_otp "$USER" "$CODE"; then
  echo "🔒 Production deployment requires OTP verification"
  echo "Usage: deploy production <service> --otp <code>"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Identity verified. Deploying $SERVICE to production..."
# ... deployment logic ...
```

### Payment Authorization

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# skills/finance/transfer.sh

source ../otp/check-status.sh

USER="$1"
AMOUNT="$2"
RECIPIENT="$3"

# Check if user verified recently
if ! check_otp_status "$USER"; then
  echo "💳 Large transfer requires fresh identity verification"
  echo "Please verify with: /otp <code>"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Processing transfer of \$$AMOUNT to $RECIPIENT"
# ... transfer logic ...
```

### Failure Hook - Alert on Failed Attempts

Configure `OTP_FAILURE_HOOK` to run a script when verification fails:

```bash
# Example: Shut down OpenClaw after 3 failures (impersonation defense)
export OTP_FAILURE_HOOK="/path/to/shutdown-if-impersonator.sh"
```

The hook receives these environment variables:
- `OTP_HOOK_EVENT` - `VERIFY_FAIL` (bad code) or `RATE_LIMIT_HIT` (too many failures)
- `OTP_HOOK_USER` - The user ID that failed
- `OTP_HOOK_FAILURE_COUNT` - Number of consecutive failures
- `OTP_HOOK_TIMESTAMP` - ISO 8601 timestamp

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# shutdown-if-impersonator.sh
if [ "$OTP_HOOK_EVENT" = "RATE_LIMIT_HIT" ]; then
  echo "🚨 OTP rate limit hit for $OTP_HOOK_USER at $OTP_HOOK_TIMESTAMP" | \
    slack-notify "#alerts"
  pkill -f openclaw
fi
```

## Security Considerations

### What This Protects Against

- **Session hijacking**: Even if someone steals your chat session, they can't execute protected actions without your physical device
- **Replay attacks**: Codes are time-based and expire quickly
- **Unauthorized actions**: Cryptographic proof that you authorized the specific action

### What This Doesn't Protect Against

- **Compromised agent**: If someone has shell access to your OpenClaw instance, they can read the secret
- **Phishing**: Users can still be tricked into providing codes to malicious actors
- **Device theft**: If someone has your authenticator device, they can generate codes

### Best Practices

1. **Store secrets securely**: Use 1Password/Bitwarden references, not plaintext in config
2. **Short expiry**: Keep `intervalHours` reasonable (8-24 hours)
3. **Audit logs**: Skills should log verification events
4. **Scope carefully**: Only require OTP for truly sensitive actions
5. **Clear prompts**: Always tell users WHY they're being asked for OTP

## Technical Details

### TOTP Implementation

- **Standard**: RFC 6238 (Time-Based One-Time Password)
- **Algorithm**: HMAC-SHA1 (standard TOTP)
- **Time window**: 30 seconds (configurable)
- **Code length**: 6 digits
- **Clock skew**: ±1 window tolerance (90 seconds total)

### YubiKey OTP Implementation

- **API**: Yubico Cloud (api.yubico.com)
- **Protocol**: HMAC-SHA1 signed requests
- **OTP Format**: 44-character ModHex (alphabet: cbdefghijklnrtuv)
- **Public ID**: First 12 characters identify the physical key
- **Replay Protection**: Handled by Yubico servers
- **Network**: Requires HTTPS to api.yubico.com

### State Management

Verification state is stored in `memory/otp-state.json`:
```json
{
  "verifications": {
    "user@example.com": {
      "verifiedAt": 1706745600000,
      "expiresAt": 1706832000000
    }
  }
}
```

No secrets are stored in state—only timestamps.

### Dependencies

**Required:**
- **jq** - for JSON state file manipulation
- **python3** - for secure YAML config parsing

**Optional:**
- **oathtool** - provides additional TOTP validation (skill has built-in generator)
- **Node.js** - only needed for `totp.mjs` standalone CLI
- **bats** - for running test suite

---

## Troubleshooting

### TOTP Issues

**"OTP verification failed"**
- Check your authenticator app has the correct secret
- Verify system time is synchronized (NTP)
- Try the code from the previous/next 30-second window

**"Secret not configured"**
- Set `OTP_SECRET` environment variable
- Or configure `security.otp.secret` in OpenClaw config

**"State file not found"**
- First verification creates the file
- Check `memory/` directory permissions

### YubiKey Issues

**"YUBIKEY_CLIENT_ID not set"**
- Get API credentials from https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey/
- Set `YUBIKEY_CLIENT_ID` and `YUBIKEY_SECRET_KEY` in environment or config

**"Invalid OTP" when getting API key**
- Your YubiKey may not be registered with Yubico's cloud
- Use YubiKey Manager to reconfigure Slot 1 with "Upload to Yubico" checked

**"YubiKey API signature mismatch"**
- Check that `YUBIKEY_SECRET_KEY` is correct (should be base64)
- Try regenerating API credentials from Yubico

**"Failed to contact Yubico API"**
- Check internet connectivity
- Yubico API requires HTTPS (port 443)
- Try: `curl -I https://api.yubico.com/wsapi/2.0/verify`

**"YubiKey OTP already used"**
- Each YubiKey press generates a unique code
- Touch your YubiKey again to generate a fresh code
- Don't copy-paste old codes

---

## Philosophy

**OTP should be invisible when not needed, obvious when required.**

Don't force users to verify for every action—that trains them to treat it as a meaningless ritual. Only challenge when:
1. The action has real-world consequences
2. The risk justifies the friction
3. You need cryptographic proof of intent

Think of OTP like `sudo`—you use it before commands that matter, not every command.
